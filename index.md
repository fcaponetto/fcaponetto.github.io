### About Me

I'm a Robotics Software Engineer currently working at [Italian Institute of Technology](https://iit.it) working on haptic robots (torque-controlled) in the teleoperation scenario.

I received my M.Sc in Computer Science from Polytechnic University of Turin, with focus on embedded systems and AI for autonomous system. 
Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from University of Catania.
