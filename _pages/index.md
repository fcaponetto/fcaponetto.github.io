I'm a Robotics Software Engineer currently working at [Italian Institute of Technology](https://iit.it) on haptic robots (torque-controlled) in the teleoperation scenario.

I received my M.Sc in Computer Science from Polytechnic University of Turin, with focus on embedded systems and AI for autonomous system. 
Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from University of Catania.

I am a jack-of-all-trades (factotum) and I like to get my hands on everything I can. I love learning new things and engaging with new people or ideas. I believe strongly in creativity and self expression through programming.
